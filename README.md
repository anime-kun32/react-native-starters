# 🚀 React Native Starters

> A curated collection of React Native starter apps generated using magically.life, for developers by developers.

## What is this?

This repository contains a growing collection of React Native starter apps generated using [Magically](https://magically.life). Each starter is designed to give you a foundation for common app patterns - helping you skip the boilerplate and focus on what makes your app unique.

These starters are:
- 📱 Built with Expo and React Native
- 🎯 Focused on specific use-cases
- 💡 Implementing common patterns and best practices
- 🔄 Regularly updated with community feedback
- 🎨 Styled with modern UI principles

## Why Use These Starters?

2. **Learn Best Practices**: Study how complex features are implemented in a real-world context.
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Perfect for hackathons, MVPs, or learning new patterns.
4. **Community Driven**: Benefit from collective knowledge and improvements.
